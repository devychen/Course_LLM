# Experiencing Co-Creativity: The Practice and Evaluation of Writing Reality Show Scripts with ChatGPT-3.5 by Professionals

**Objectives**

**Abstract**
This project is a first attempt on the application of large language models (ChatGPT-3.5) into co-creating variety show scripts, practising and evaluating by professionals. Currently, the development of language models has brought profound effects on the content creation industry but the realm of variety show production does not seem to be explored. Based on quantitative questionnaires and qualitative interviews, this project highlights the advantages and disadvantages of ChatGPT-3.5 in casting and script writing, envisioning a fine-tuned co-writing system in the future.

**Introduction**
The application of large language models in various forms of content creation such as visual arts and playwriting is a prominent research topic, particularly in the realm of story or narrative generation which has been extensively discussed (Rosa et al., 2020 & 2022; Yuan et al, 2022). The release of ChatGPT4 has taken this interest to another level, arising concerns among professionals in the creative industry including screenplay writers and book/magazine editors who become increasingly worried about the industrial future. A notable and significant event in this context is a series of strikes launched mainly by Hollywood writers and actors, including the 2023 SAG-AFTRA (Screen Actors Guild – American Federation of Television and Radio Artists) strike. The primary reason behind it concerns a controversial contract that will guarantee the adoption of AI-generated screenplays and actors. However, there is a lack of structured review on the potential roles of those recent large language models in shaping the future of the industry, whether they pose a threat, serve as augmentative tools, or hold other possibilities. Notably, its role in the realm of variety shows which is a significant genre in the entertainment business has yet to be explored.

A most recent study is Mirowsky et al (2023), in which they invited 15 professionals in the theatre and film industry to co-write scripts using a newly developed system called Dramatron based on the Chinchilla large language model (Hoffmann et al 2022). Their study has demonstrated the possibilities and potentials of large language models in human-machine co-creativity on playwriting. This project is inspired by their work. However, in contrast to their work, this project looks at the variety shows instead of theatre plays, which is rarely researched under this topic. And additionally, while their study primarily focuses on evaluating the utility of Dramatron as a system specially designed for playwriting only, this project aims to closely examine the interactions between directors and large language models in the production process with script writing being the dominant part of it. Ideally, the outcomes of this project would serve as a valuable guideline for future developments on specialised variety show production systems based on large language models.

To elaborate, this project seeks to address the following questions:
1) To what extent can large language models be identified as a co-writer? Subsequently，what is the most accurate description for the potential role of current large language models during the production process?
2) How effective and creative can large language models be?
3) Recommendations for user experiences for the future developments.
